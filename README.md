# Enoslist

This project is a small attempt to create a tool in order to import, export and modify RTL netlists.
It is wanted to allow different format for the import and the export.
The netlist modification aims to be as permissive as possible.


/!\ For the moment the only datatype available is the 'bit', 'bit_vector' could come later. /!\


/!\ Rspec specification files not up to date /!\

ToDo : 

- Restructure program module, unique module 'Netlist' to be divided in multiple modules.
